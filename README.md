# Draw.new

A drawing program to be primarily used with stylus pens.<br>
The goal is to make a program that automatically detects both straight and curved lines, and then converts them into a vector image.<br>
Also, rulers etc. will be added to help with math or other school-related tasks.<br>
Colors and gradients are also planned to be added.

### The program is currently in the earliest stages of development, so there is not much to see here yet, and there is also no clear goal yet.
